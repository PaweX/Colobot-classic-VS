Welcome to my repository of classic Colobot, originally cloned from TerranovaTeam's original colobot repository.
In this repository you can find project files that allow you to compile the code under VS12 or newer.

See https://github.com/colobot/colobot/tree/colobot-original to find the original source.

This repository contains the source files of Colobot game released on open source license (GNU GPLv3) by the producer Epsitec CH. The sources were released and the rights granted to a group of Polish Colobot fans centered around the site http://colobot.cba.pl/ . This repository contains only the source code of the game. The necessary data files will soon be available as a separate download. For now, though, you can download the original download package released by Epsitec (the link is on http://colobot.cba.pl/ site).

For more information on the project, see the wiki pages.


Compiling and running the game

The code can be compiled using the Visual Studio.

For these instructions see HOWTO.txt file.
